Knee arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that allows an orthopaedic surgeon to see inside the knee joint using a small camera.

This advanced technique helps diagnose and treat various knee problems with smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery compared to open surgery.

During the procedure, a thin tube with a camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the knee. The surgeon can then view the joint on a screen and use specialised instruments to repair or remove damaged tissues.

## Knee Arthroscopy is Commonly Recommended For:

Knee arthroscopy is commonly recommended for a variety of conditions, including:

*   Meniscus tears
*   Damaged cartilage
*   Removal of loose bone or cartilage fragments
*   ACL or PCL ligament reconstruction
*   Treating inflamed joint lining (synovitis)
*   Cleaning out infection or scar tissue in the knee

## Key Medical Advice

If you have persistent knee pain, swelling, locking, or instability that is not improving with non-surgical treatment, consult an experienced orthopaedic surgeon in your area. Early diagnosis and timely arthroscopy can help restore knee function and prevent further damage.
