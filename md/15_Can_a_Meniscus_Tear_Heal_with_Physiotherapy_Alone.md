A meniscus tear is a common knee injury that affects the cartilage acting as a cushion between the thigh bone and shin bone.

Patients often ask if physiotherapy alone can heal it, without surgery. The answer depends on the type and severity of the tear.

## When Physiotherapy Can Be Effective:

Physiotherapy alone may be sufficient for:
*   Small or partial tears.
*   Tears on the outer edge of the meniscus (where blood supply is better).
*   Symptoms that improve with rest and exercise therapy.

## How Physiotherapy Supports Healing:

Physiotherapy helps by:
*   Reducing swelling and inflammation.
*   Strengthening the quadriceps and hamstrings.
*   Improving joint stability and mobility.
*   Teaching safe movements to protect the knee.

## When Surgery May Be Needed:

Surgery is typically recommended for:
*   Large or complex tears.
*   Persistent pain, swelling, or knee locking despite physiotherapy.
*   Associated ligament injuries such as ACL tears.

Every meniscus injury is different, and not all respond the same way to non-surgical care.

If you have ongoing knee pain or instability, consult an orthopaedic doctor in Bangalore.

A proper diagnosis through clinical examination and MRI will guide whether physiotherapy alone is enough, or if surgical repair is necessary to restore knee function.
