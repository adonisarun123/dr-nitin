## Introduction

Are you struggling with **back pain**, **numbness**, or **leg weakness** that’s affecting your daily routine? You might be dealing with a **herniated disc**—a common spinal condition that can cause significant discomfort and impact your mobility.

The good news? Relief is possible with the right diagnosis and treatment. In this blog, we’ll help you understand what a herniated disc is, how it’s treated, and why consulting **Dr. Nithin N**, an experienced Orthopaedic specialist in Bangalore, can be your first step toward recovery.

## What Is a Herniated Disc?

Your spine is made up of bones (vertebrae) cushioned by soft discs that absorb shock and support movement. A **herniated disc**—also known as a slipped or ruptured disc—occurs when one of these discs bulges out or breaks open, often pressing on nearby nerves.

### Common Symptoms

Common symptoms of a herniated disc include:

*   Persistent **back or neck pain**
*   **Numbness or tingling** in the arms or legs
*   **Muscle weakness**, especially in the legs
*   Pain that worsens with movement or certain positions
*   Sciatica (pain radiating from the lower back down one leg)

## Why You Shouldn’t Ignore It

While some herniated discs heal with rest and conservative treatment, others can worsen over time if left unaddressed. Severe cases may affect nerve function or even bladder and bowel control.

Early evaluation and treatment can:

*   Reduce pain quickly
*   Prevent long-term nerve damage
*   Restore your strength and mobility
*   Help you avoid surgery in many cases
