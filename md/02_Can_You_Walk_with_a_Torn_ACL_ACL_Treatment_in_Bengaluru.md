## Introduction

One of the most common questions people ask after a knee injury is:
**“Can I still walk if I’ve torn my ACL?”**

The short answer is **yes** — in many cases, walking is still possible even with a torn ACL. But just because you can walk doesn’t mean the injury isn’t serious. In fact, ignoring it can lead to long-term complications that may affect your mobility and quality of life.

In this blog, we’ll help you understand what a torn ACL really means, what symptoms to look for, and how to treat it properly with the help of expert orthopaedic care in Bengaluru.

## What Is an ACL Tear?

The **ACL (anterior cruciate ligament)** is one of the key ligaments in your knee that provides stability, especially during activities like running, jumping, or changing direction quickly. It’s commonly injured during sports, falls, or sudden twisting movements.

## Can You Walk with a Torn ACL?

Yes — it’s possible to walk with a torn ACL, especially once the initial swelling and pain subside. However, patients often report:

*   A feeling of the knee **“giving way”** during movement
*   Difficulty with **twisting, pivoting, or turning**
*   Ongoing **swelling and instability**

This can be misleading, as walking in a straight line may feel okay, but the knee remains structurally unstable — especially during physical activity.

## What Happens If You Ignore an ACL Tear?

Leaving an ACL tear untreated can lead to:

*   **Further damage** to the **meniscus or cartilage**
*   **Chronic knee instability** during daily activities or sports
*   A higher risk of **early-onset knee arthritis**
*   Loss of confidence in physical movement

That’s why it’s important to consult an orthopaedic specialist early and plan the right course of action.
