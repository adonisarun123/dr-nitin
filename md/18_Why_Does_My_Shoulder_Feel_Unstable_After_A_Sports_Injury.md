# Why Does My Shoulder Feel Unstable After A Sports Injury?

Shoulder instability is a common problem athletes face after injuries.

The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, but this mobility comes at the cost of stability.

After a fall, collision, or sudden movement, the supporting structures can be stretched or torn, leading to instability.

## Here are common reasons your shoulder may feel unstable:

**Ligament or capsule injury** – These tissues hold the shoulder in place. If they are overstretched, the joint may feel loose.

**Labral tear** – The labrum is a cartilage rim that deepens the socket. A tear here often causes repeated slipping or clicking.

**Rotator cuff weakness** – These muscles stabilize the joint. Injury or weakness makes the shoulder more likely to shift.

**Recurrent dislocations** – Once the shoulder slips out, it is more prone to repeat instability, especially in young athletes.

Treatment options include rest, physiotherapy to strengthen stabilizing muscles, and in some cases, minimally invasive surgery to repair damaged tissues.

If you are facing shoulder pain or instability after a sports injury, consult an orthopaedic doctor in Bangalore for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.

Early care can prevent long-term damage and help you return safely to activity.
