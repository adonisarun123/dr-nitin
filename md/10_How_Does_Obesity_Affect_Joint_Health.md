# How Does Obesity Affect Joint Health?

## Introduction

When we think about the effects of obesity, we often focus on heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure. But did you know that **excess weight can significantly impact your joints** as well?

Your joints, especially the **knees, hips, and lower back**, bear the burden of your body weight every time you move. Even small increases in weight can create **excess pressure**, accelerating wear and tear. In this blog, we’ll explore how obesity affects joint health and what you can do to protect your mobility and long-term wellness.

## How Extra Weight Impacts Your Joints

Joints are designed to support body weight and allow smooth movement. However, carrying excess weight increases the stress placed on these joints—especially the **weight-bearing ones**.

### Did You Know?

For every extra **1 kg** of body weight, your knees absorb up to **4 kg of additional force** when walking. This added load leads to:

*   **Faster breakdown** of cartilage
*   **Increased risk of osteoarthritis**
*   **Greater joint pain and stiffness**
*   **Reduced ability to stay physically active**

Over time, this creates a **cycle of inactivity and worsening pain**, which can severely impact your quality of life.

## Obesity and Inflammation

Beyond mechanical stress, obesity is also linked to **chronic low-grade inflammation** in the body. This inflammation:

*   Aggravates joint pain
*   Slows healing after injury
*   May worsen conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or tendonitis

So, even joints that aren’t weight-bearing—like those in your hands or shoulders—can be affected.

## Why Managing Weight Matters

The good news is that **even modest weight loss** can make a big difference. Losing just **5–10% of your body weight** can:

*   Reduce joint pain and stiffness
*   Improve physical function and mobility
*   Delay or prevent the need for joint surgery
*   Support overall health and reduce inflammation
