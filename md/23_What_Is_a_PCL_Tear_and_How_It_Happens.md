# What Is a PCL Tear and How It Happens

A posterior cruciate ligament tear affects one of the main ligaments that stabilizes the knee.

The PCL helps keep the shinbone from moving backward and supports knee balance during walking, bending, and sudden movements.

When this ligament is injured, the knee may feel unstable and painful, especially during weight bearing activities.

## Causes of a PCL Tear

*   **Direct impact to the knee:** A strong blow to the front of the knee, often during sports or accidents, can push the shinbone backward and injure the PCL.
*   **Sports strain:** High-impact sports such as football, basketball, and tennis place repeated stress on the knee, increasing the risk of meniscus damage. Athletes with combined injuries often require both ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair for full knee stability.
*   **Falling on a bent knee:** Landing hard on a flexed knee can strain or tear the ligament.
*   **Sudden twisting movements:** Quick changes in direction during sports can overload the ligament.
*   **Motor vehicle injuries:** A sudden force from the dashboard hitting the knee can cause a PCL tear.
*   **Severe hyperextension:** Stretching the knee too far backward may damage the ligament.

## Key Medical Information and Advice

PCL tears may cause swelling, pain, and difficulty walking or bending the knee.

**Early evaluation helps prevent long term instability.**
