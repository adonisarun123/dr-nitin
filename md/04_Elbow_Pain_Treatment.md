# Elbow Pain Treatment

## Dr. Nitin Sunku

Elbow pain when lifting, gripping, or typing? It might be **Tennis Elbow**.

**Tennis Elbow (lateral epicondylitis)** is a common condition caused by overuse of the forearm muscles — not just in tennis players, but also in gym-goers, office workers, and manual laborers.

### Symptoms

Symptoms often include:
*   Pain on the outer part of the elbow
*   Weakness in the grip
*   Discomfort during daily tasks

### Progression and Treatment

Without proper care, the condition can worsen and limit hand and arm function.

**Treatment options** range from:
*   Physiotherapy
*   Braces
*   Shockwave therapy
*   Minor procedures (in severe cases)

As an orthopaedic doctor and sports medicine specialist in HSR Layout, I provide personalised treatment plans for long-term relief and recovery.
