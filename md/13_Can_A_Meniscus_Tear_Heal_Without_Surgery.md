# Can A Meniscus Tear Heal Without Surgery?

A meniscus tear is a common knee injury that affects the cartilage acting as a cushion between your thigh bone and shin bone.

Whether it can heal without surgery depends on the type, size, and location of the tear.

Small tears on the outer edge of the meniscus often have a better blood supply and may heal with rest, physiotherapy, and activity modification.

Larger or complex tears, especially in areas with poor blood supply, may not heal fully and could require surgical repair.

## Your Doctor May Recommend:

*   Rest, ice, compression, and elevation
*   Physiotherapy to strengthen surrounding muscles
*   Avoiding activities that worsen pain
*   Surgery if symptoms persist or the tear affects stability

A proper diagnosis and treatment plan from an orthopaedic specialist is important to protect your knee health and prevent long-term damage.
