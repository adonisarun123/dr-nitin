# Why Do I Get Shin Splints After Running?

Shin splints, also called **medial tibial stress syndrome**, are a common cause of leg pain in runners and athletes. They occur when the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your shin bone become overworked.

## Common Causes of Shin Splints

The following factors can contribute to the development of shin splints:

*   **Sudden increase in running distance or intensity:** Rapidly increasing the duration or speed of runs without allowing the body to adapt.
*   **Running on hard surfaces:** Training on unforgiving surfaces like concrete can increase impact forces.
*   **Wearing worn-out or improper shoes:** Lack of adequate support or cushioning from footwear.
*   **Flat feet or improper running technique:** Biomechanical issues that place undue stress on the lower leg.
*   **Lack of warm-up or stretching:** Insufficient preparation before exercise.

## Recognizing Shin Splints (Symptoms)

The symptoms of shin splints typically include:

*   Dull or sharp pain along the inner side of the shin.
*   Pain that worsens with activity and eases with rest.
*   Mild swelling in the lower leg.

**Note on Surgery:** The original article included a section titled "When is surgery recommended?" followed by a list of symptoms. This appears to be a formatting error in the source, as surgery is not typically recommended for the symptoms listed. The list describes the symptoms of shin splints, not the criteria for surgery.

## Key Medical Advice: How to Manage Shin Splints

Management of shin splints focuses on reducing inflammation and addressing the underlying causes.

**Immediate Steps:**

*   **Rest:** Reduce or stop activities that worsen the pain.
*   **Ice:** Apply ice to the affected area to reduce inflammation.
*   **Proper Footwear:** Use shoes with adequate cushioning and support.

**Rehabilitation and Prevention:**

*   **Stretching and Strengthening:** Perform exercises targeting the calves and shins.
*   **Gradual Return to Running:** Only resume running under guidance, ensuring a slow and progressive increase in intensity and distance.

**When to Consult a Doctor:**

If shin pain persists despite rest and home management, it is crucial to consult an orthopaedic doctor. Proper diagnosis is essential to rule out more serious conditions like **stress fractures** or other underlying causes, ensuring a treatment plan is tailored to your specific needs.
