# Can PRP Injections Help with Chronic Joint Pain?

Chronic joint pain — whether in the knee, shoulder, hip, or ankle — can limit daily activities and affect quality of life.

Many patients now ask about Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections as a treatment option.

## What is PRP?

PRP uses a small amount of your own blood, which is processed to concentrate platelets.

These platelets release growth factors that support healing and reduce inflammation.

A proper diagnosis and treatment plan from an orthopaedic specialist is important to protect your knee health and prevent long-term damage.

## When PRP may help:

*   Osteoarthritis in the knee or hip
*   Tendon injuries such as tennis elbow
*   Cartilage damage from wear and tear
*   Sports-related joint pain that does not improve with rest or physiotherapy

## Benefits of PRP therapy:

*   Uses your body’s natural healing process
*   Minimally invasive, non-surgical option
*   Can reduce pain and improve joint mobility
*   Helps delay or avoid major surgery in some cases

While PRP is not a cure for every condition, it can be highly effective in selected patients.

A proper diagnosis by an orthopaedic doctor in Bangalore is essential to decide if PRP injections are suitable for your joint pain.
