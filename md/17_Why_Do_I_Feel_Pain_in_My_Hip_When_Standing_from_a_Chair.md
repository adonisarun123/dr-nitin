# Why Do I Feel Pain in My Hip When Standing from a Chair?

Hip pain while rising from a chair is a common complaint, especially in middle-aged and older adults.

This discomfort can interfere with daily activities and often signals an underlying joint issue.

## Here are some possible causes:

*   **Hip arthritis** – Damage to the cartilage makes the hip joint stiff and painful, especially when moving from sitting to standing.
*   **Hip impingement** – Extra bone growth or joint misalignment can cause pinching pain when the hip bends and straightens.
*   **Muscle weakness** – Weak gluteal or thigh muscles reduce support, forcing the joint to bear more stress.
*   **Bursitis** – Inflammation of fluid-filled sacs around the hip may trigger sharp pain when standing up.
*   **Tendon strain** – Overuse or sudden movements can irritate tendons that support the hip.

Early signs like stiffness, catching, or swelling should not be ignored.

Conservative treatments include physiotherapy, posture correction, activity modification, and medication.

If symptoms persist, advanced options such as injections or minimally invasive surgery may be advised.

If you regularly feel hip pain when standing, consult an orthopaedic doctor in Bangalore for accurate diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan.

Early evaluation helps prevent worsening and protects your joint health.
