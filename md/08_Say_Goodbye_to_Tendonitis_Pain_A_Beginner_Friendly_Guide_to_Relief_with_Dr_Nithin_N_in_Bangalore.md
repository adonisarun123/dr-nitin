## Introduction

Are you experiencing persistent pain, swelling, or stiffness in your joints that’s affecting your daily life?

## Understanding Tendonitis: Key Concepts Simplified

### 1. What is Tendonitis?
Tendonitis is the inflammation or irritation of a tendon—a tough band of tissue that connects muscles to bones. This condition can occur in any tendon but is most commonly found in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle.

### 2. Signs and Symptoms to Watch For
*   Sharp or dull pain near joints
*   Swelling and tenderness around the affected area
*   Joint stiffness or reduced range of motion
*   Pain worsening with movement or activity
*   A crackling or grating sensation during movement

### 3. Common Causes
*   Repetitive motion (e.g., typing, sports, lifting)
*   Sudden increase in physical activity
*   Poor posture or technique during exercise
*   Age-related wear and tear
*   Injury or trauma to the joint

### 4. Who is at Risk?
Tendonitis can affect anyone, but individuals who engage in repetitive tasks—athletes, fitness enthusiasts, or those with physically demanding jobs—are more likely to develop it. Even office workers are not immune, especially if ergonomic setups are poor.
